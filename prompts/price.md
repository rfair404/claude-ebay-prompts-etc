# PRICE — v3, Function 2

Obeys [`_shared.md`](_shared.md). Read it first.

**Output:** `<shoot-dir>/price.txt` (overwrite).

Find what the same or nearly-identical item actually sold for, establish
a defensible price, and surface category-specific selling risks. Reads
IDENTIFY records.

## Autonomy (Goal: dig for the exact match, don't ask permission to look)

No step in PRICE gates or stops. v2 made you propose queries and wait,
and Apify used to require cost approval — v3 does neither. You construct
queries, run the stages, and iterate them yourself. PRICE runs
end-to-end without ever stopping for the user.

## Selling-unit awareness

Query the selling unit, not pieces. `pair` → include "pair";
`set` → "set"/"set of N"; `lot` → "lot of N"/"mixed lot" (lots sell at a
discount to sum-of-parts — single-item comps ×N are Tier C reference
only); `duplicate` → price one piece (CURATE scales). All quoted prices
are per-listing-unit except `duplicate` (per-piece).

## The exact-match hunt (run before any era-peer fallback)

For each item, hunt the exact match, escalating only as each stage dries
up. Do NOT settle for an era-peer until the hunt is exhausted. Every
stage is autonomous — PRICE never stops to ask.

1. **Canonical query** — built from IDENTIFY's short Brand+Type+Era
   values (not the Distinguishing-marks prose). Bare words; drop
   punctuation and filler ("with/and/the"). 5–9 high-signal keywords —
   real seller-title density, so exact comps can exist. Include era ONLY
   if a printed date is visible in a photo.

2. **Stage A — WebSearch** (free, ~5s, broad). Casts wide across the open
   web + marketplaces. Tag `[A — WebSearch]`.

3. **Stage B — Apify eBay sold** (the default direct-eBay comp source; no
   gate). Run `python lib/apify_ebay.py "<query>"` (or `search_ebay_sold()`
   programmatically) — it calls the eBay sold-listings Actor and returns
   structured comps with per-item URLs, sold dates, condition, currency,
   and seller stats. Headless, no browser. Tag `[B — Apify]`. Cost is
   ~$0.12/run and runs automatically as part of the hunt.
   - **Data-quality guardrails (Apify is trusted by default now, so check
     it):** keep only `sold_currency == USD` rows — the Actor can silently
     return GBP/BRL prices at face value; drop (or convert + note) any
     non-USD comp. Drop the usual outliers (single bid, >2× median). If a
     run returns suspiciously few rows, or dispersion that disagrees badly
     with Stage A, treat confidence as **LOW** and trigger Stage C.
   - **If Apify is unconfigured or the run fails** (no token / ApifyError /
     timeout): fall through to Stage C for the same eBay-sold data. Note
     "Apify unavailable → Chrome" in the Hunt line.

4. **If no exact match yet, broaden and re-run A+B:** drop the
   least-load-bearing keyword (5→3 words), then try a synonym for Type.
   Iterate 2–3 formulations.

5. **Stage C — Chrome → eBay sold (OPTIONAL — low-confidence only).** The
   browser browse path is no longer routine. Invoke it ONLY when
   confidence is still LOW after A+B — i.e. any of:
   - no exact match, or fewer than ~3 usable USD sold comps;
   - dispersion too wide to anchor a tier (roughly >2× spread among the
     candidate anchors);
   - Apify was unavailable/suspect and you need direct-eBay data;
   - high-value item where a wrong anchor is costly and a ~60s second read
     is worth it.

   When triggered: SOLD URL with `LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1&_sop=3`. Extract
   rows prefixed "Sold <date>"; skip Sponsored / "Shop on eBay" house ads.
   Tag `[C — Chrome]`. `get_page_text` gives titles/prices/dates but not
   per-item URLs; when you can't capture each href (via `read_page`/
   `find`), cite the SOLD-search URL as the verifiable source and say so.
   Subject to browser read-tier limits (see [list_edit_chrome.md](list_edit_chrome.md)).

6. **Active fallback** (only when sold returns zero direct matches): drop
   the sold filters, capture active listings, tag `[active — ASKING
   PRICE]`, treat as Tier C ceiling-context only.

7. **Cross-reference** A vs B (vs C if it ran): agreement = high-confidence
   anchor; divergence = trust the direct-eBay sold source (B/C) over A's
   broad web results.

Only after the hunt dries up do you fall back to the closest era-peer —
and then state how hard you looked ("3 formulations, A+B+C, no exact
match"). Per _shared, an exact match found this way beats any era-peer;
commit to it.

## Apify notes (the Stage B backend)

Apify is now the default Stage B source and runs without a gate. It has
documented quirks — run-to-run coverage variance, silent GBP→USD,
historical BRL inflation (raw evidence under `deprecated/`). The Stage-B
guardrails above (USD-only filter, outlier drop, dispersion check, Chrome
cross-check when suspect) exist specifically to catch these. To run
without Apify entirely, leave the Apify token unset — Stage B then routes
to Chrome (Stage C) automatically.

## URLs (mandatory)

Every comp carries a clickable source URL. A comp without a URL is not a
comp.

## Output

Lead with the headline, then comps, then the three tiers, then research.

    Max supported price: $X   [anchored on: <exact match | era-peer + gap>]

Per item:

    === PRICE — Item <N> (<short name>) ===
    Comps refreshed: YYYY-MM-DD   ·   Data quality: good / partial / thin
    Hunt: <one line — formulations tried, sources, exact-match yes/no>

For each scenario (or just "primary" when no bracket — most items):

    Query: <query>   Source(s): <A / B / C>
    Tier A — direct match (anchors price):
      • $<price> — "<title>"  ·  Sold <date>, <condition>
                  Match: <one line>   URL: <url>
    Tier B — branded/mint ceiling:
      • $<price> — "<title>"  ·  Ceiling note: <why ceiling not anchor>   URL: <url>
    Tier C — excluded:
      • $<price> — "<title>"  ·  Reason: <single bid / <50 fb seller / >2× median / asking price>   URL: <url>

Mark comps >12 months old `[STALE]`. Every Tier C needs a specific
reason.

### Three tiers (always)

- **Conservative** — no-objection floor; closest era-peer / category-mid.
- **Recommended (max supported)** — the headline; strongest comp (exact
  match if the hunt found one). **In headless flow this becomes the
  provisional working price** (SOFT gate — logged to NEEDS_REVIEW, not a
  stop).
- **Push-high** — defensible ceiling; highest comparable + the stated
  premium reason.

### No-exact-match case

State plainly that no exact comp was found; anchor on the closest
era-peer with the gap noted; flag the rarity signal; suggest saving the
eBay search as a watch; note the SEO upside of year-specific attribution.
The three tiers still apply, anchored on the era-peer.

### Close

    Working price (provisional): $X (Recommended tier). Final price is the
    user's call at publish time; recorded here for review.

(No stop. Headless adopts the provisional price and logs it; PRICE runs
end-to-end without a gate.)

## Research notes (per item — catches what comps can't)

Keep each to 2–4 lines; `N/A — <reason>` if a section truly doesn't apply.

- **Authenticity & fakes** — does this category have a repro problem?
  Name the tell + an auth step (e.g. Bakelite hot-water test; band-tee
  tag dating; Tiffany lamps mostly repro). Else "no significant risk".
- **Restrictions & legal** — eBay-prohibited, CITES (ivory/fur/
  taxidermy), NAGPRA, militaria region-bans, hazmat, recalls, intl-ship
  eligibility, US-state rules. Answer: sellable internationally? Else
  "none identified".
- **Scams & buyer issues** — switch-in-box, altered slabs, "didn't work"
  returns, vintage-clothing disputes — + the protection. Else "none".
- **Authenticity Guarantee** — does eBay cover this category at this
  value tier? Else N/A.
- **Disclosure** — what to state up front to head off returns (rim/foot
  chips, odors, untested status, foxing). Else "standard sufficient".

## Skip / honesty

- Skip `none (not for sale)` items. DO run PRICE on
  `needs_followup_photo: yes` items (tells the user if a re-shoot pays).
- Don't invent comps — say "thin/absent" outright.
- Fresh-comp rule: gather for THIS item every run; never reuse prior
  classifications.

## Closing

Per _shared: working-price headline + path. Don't restate the comp list.
